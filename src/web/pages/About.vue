        Nightwatch is designed to simplify the process of managing a Discord
        server. In a typical server, there are multiple bots to handle a number
        of different functions: moderation, user management, plugins, etc.
      </p>
      <p>
        Nightwatch is designed to be a one-and-done bot that encompasses all of
        these functions and more.
